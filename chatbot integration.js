Youâ€™ll have a heck of a lot more fun. And base case youâ€™ll have the same net worth creation as your current path over the next ~10 years. And upside case youâ€™ll have much moreâ€¦",

And weâ€™ve gotten good at it. Very good at it. We want to keep launching vehicles but our bottleneck is CEO talent. Specifically, weâ€™re looking for a young high-horsepower CEO like you. We donâ€™t care about operating experience. We just care about work-ethic, integrity, and kindness, and we can teach you how to be the best at the rest of it ðŸ˜‰",
